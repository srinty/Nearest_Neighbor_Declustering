# Nearest_Neighbor_Declustering
This repository gives an example of catalog declustering with Nearest Neighbor approach. 
The example code is given for Yellowstone seismicity 2008-2022. 
Dependencies:

Python 3.7 Numpy, matplotlib, matplotlib-Basemap, scipy, scipy, datetime, calendar

The original nearest neighbor codes are available at: https://github.com/tgoebel/clustering-analysis. We modified the codes as per our dataset, added fractal dimension analysis and declustering process.
